type: "Agiles Methods"

I have worked with Agiles methods for a while.
To simplify their use, I setup cool things like:

- Automated morning meeting
    - using Slack, Zapier & Google Calendar
- Continuous Integration
    - using Drone and homemade Docker images
- Github Pull-Request Workflow
    - for collaborating code review & suite test passing before shipping
